# Introduction to HTML5
- HTML5 is a core technology markup language of the internet used for structuring and presenting markup content
for the world wide web.
- Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and browsers (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
- HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4, but also XHTML1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
- Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the fact that HTML and XHTML in common
use on the world wide web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web broswers, those established by common practice.
- It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML.
- It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and rationalizes
the markup available for documents, and introduces markup for application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.
- For the same reasons, HTML5 is a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications.
- Many features of HTML5 have been built the consideration of being able to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
- In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. 
- These include the new < video >, < audio >, and < canvas > elements as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content (replacing generic < object > tags, and MathML for mathematical formulas.
- These features are designed to make it easy and include and handle mathematical and graphical content on the web without 
having to resort to proprietary plugins and APIs.
- Other new elements such as < section >, < article >, < header >, and < nav >, are designed to enrich the semantic content of 
documents. New attributes can be introduced for the same purpose, while some elements and attributes have been removed.
- Some elements, such as < a >, < cite >, and < menu > have been changed, redefined, or standardized.
- The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification.
- HTML5 also defines in some detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors will be treated
uniformly by all conforming browsers and user agents.

#HTML5 Markup
- HTML5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites.
<ul> 
<li>Semantic replacements for common uses of generic block (< div >) and inline (< span >) elements; for example, < nav > (website
navigation block) and < footer > (usually referring to the bottom of the webpage or to last lines of HTML code).</li>
<li>< audio > and < video > instead of the <object> tag</li>
<li>Purely presentational elements such as < font > and < center > have been dropped; Casdcading Style sheets are used instead.
</ul>
